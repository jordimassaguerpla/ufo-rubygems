  <h1>Ruby gems security update frequency</h1>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
  Ruby gems get updated, but how often? And why it matters? Knowing the frequency
  of the updates can help us predict how much effort will mean to maintain a ruby
  application which requires a given set of gems.</p>
  <p>
  In order to have a good prediction, we need to look at the history and how this
  data looks like. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In chart#1 we can see a plot where the <i>x-axis</i> is the year and the <i>y-axis</i> is the
  number of <b>security</b> updates. We have chosen to look at the security ones
  cause that is when you MUST update. To be fair, we are looking at the security issues, 
  and we are assuming each security issue means an update.</p>
  
  <p>We deliberately choose ignoring other updates, as it is what you will usually do, unless they fix a bug which fixes an issue on your app.</p>
  
  <p>You can select and unselect a different set of gems. Use that
  tool to help you decide which gems should you use on your project and have an idea
  on the number of times you may have to update them.
