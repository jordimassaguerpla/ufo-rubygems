Update FOrecast for rubygems

This project aims to provide data visualization to help infer a model that could predict the security updates for a set of rubygems.

Data for this project comes from the [ruby-advisory-db](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db) project.

Inspired on [UFO, Updates Forecast for openSUSE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/updateforecast/)
